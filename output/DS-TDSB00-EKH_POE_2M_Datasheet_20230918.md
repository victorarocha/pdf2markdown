# **DS-TDSB00-EKH/POE/2M** **Auxiliary Care Radar Sensor** **Introduction**

Based on the 60 GHz frequency band, vital sign detection radar adopts FMCW, MIMO, beamforming, micro-Doppler feature
extraction, and other technologies. It can detect the vital signs, including person, breath, heartbeat, etc. Vital sign detection
radar can be installed above the bed in the bedroom, and the non-contact detection will cover the bed. It can obtain the
information, including the time in the bed, the time out of the bed, breath rate, heart rate, times of movements, etc., and
help to analyze the sleep quality and health of the human body.


 No privacy disclosure.


 Remote and non-contact detection.


 Outputs the real-time breath rate and heart rate of the human body.


 Detects and outputs the information that if the human body is in the bed to the connected client software. Counts the time


in the bed and the time out of the bed.


 Detects and outputs the human body movements to the connected client software, and counts the times of movements.


 Supports transmitting data to platform by OTAP protocol.


 Supports connecting to Wi-Fi.


 Supports side mounting and cell mounting.
